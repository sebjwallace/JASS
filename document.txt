setStyles sends the object of styles to the Store with a Token.

The Store holds all styles, media queries and mixins. Each style is wrapped in a Style object with metadata such as token and children.

The Store updates each style with new values and scans for inheritance, then sets the token for the styles not current.
	If there is inheritance it also updates the parent with a new child, if it has not already been added.
	It also sets the current attribute of the parents token to false

The Store then loops through all tokens for non current attributes.
It then sends all selectors with non current tokens to the Compiler.

The Compiler outputs a string to be appended to the style tag associated with the tag.
